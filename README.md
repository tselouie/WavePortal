# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```



Run test script: ```npx hardhat run scripts/run.js```
# 3 Step Deployment

1. Deploy contract with this command: ```npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network rinkeby```

2. Use Contract Address and input into front-end

3. Copy contract json from artifacts/contracts/contractName into utils/contractName in front-end
